# Simon Game

This is a simple Simon game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game follows the rules of the original Simon game, where the player must repeat a sequence of colors played by the game.

## Installation

To run this game locally, you can simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Press any random key to begin the game.
2. The game will generate a random sequence of colors.
3. The player must repeat the sequence of colors played by the game.
4. If the player correctly repeats the sequence, the game will continue with a new sequence.
5. If the player makes an error, the game is over and can restart if needed.
